## Description
>b"Two of our members, Simon and Anna were arguing about wheres better to take notes.\r\n\r\nSimon thinks that Github isnt the best place to take your notes because you might leave something public behind by accident, like maybe a note about someone you didnt want public.\r\n\r\nAnna disagrees because you can just delete it and recommit anyway, and it looks good to be active on Github!\r\n\r\nSimon reminded them that we can see the changes... even what they wrote about Tom.\r\n\r\nAnna rushed off, but now were not sure what theyre talking about. Could you figure it out?\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloped by [Cyb3rSw0rd](https://github.com/AlfredSimpson)"

## Description
>b"Students often blame bad teachers for bad grades and having to take extra semesters here at NJIT. Some wish they could go back in time to fix what went wrong. What if the fault wasnt a lack of studying? What if their bad luck was caused by something beyond their control?\r\n\r\nWe should look into it and see what we can find out.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by [royCardigan](https://github.com/rickyhernandez1000)"

## Description
>> Sponsored by [Mirai Security](https://miraisecurity.com/)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nWhen we first launched Viking Axe Co, we utilized a legacy cloud static website to store our battle-axes. At the time, we believed that this was a secure solution, and that our axes were safe from harm. Unfortunately, we were wrong. Our website was hacked, and our precious battle-axes were stolen. It was a devastating blow, and it made us realize the importance of cybersecurity in the modern age.

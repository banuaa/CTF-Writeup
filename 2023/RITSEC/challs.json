Our prized utility of choice is a service that we provide, called Steg as a service. <s>Since all the 1337 threat actors use steghide to exfiltrate data,</s> This service allows anyone to upload a file to see if steghide can find any hidden information inside it. <br><br>\r\nUnfortunately,  we've recently discovered that we got our copies of steghide from a shady source, and our team has discovered and patched a sneaky backdoor inside it!!! However, since the backdoored version of steghide doesn't trigger any antivirus detections, we've been having trouble convincing our managers to change the version of steghide into a secure one.  Can you try exploiting our shady copy of steghide so that we can convince our managers to update the binary? <br><br>\r\n\r\nWe've spun up a copy of our Steg service at <a href=\"http://host1.metaproblems.com:5830\">http://host1.metaproblems.com:5830</a> for you to target.

Unfortunately, our team member who discovered the backdoor is currently on PTO, so I can't provide you with the exact details on what the backdoor was. However, I could give you our <a href=\"https://metaproblems.com/769829afb2a31c32e153cc53484f346a/steghide-patched\" target=\"_blank\">patched steghide</a> if it helps.\r\n<br><br><b>Note:</b> Although this is hosted as a web service, the intended vulnerability is within the steghide binary, not the web service.</p>\r\n\r\nNOTE: This flag's format is MetaCTF{}",

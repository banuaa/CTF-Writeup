Crack the code, reveal the key,
And i also have code to my vault name "34T".
And the secret, yours it will be if you combined what i have.

But my darling was not able to do so.
All she must do is to read and figure out.
Now i ask you this, am i complicated?
Or she's just loss the mind of my riddle?

I'm a secret you must unveil,
A puzzle wrapped in a cryptic tale.
Within my grasp, the answer lies,
Decrypt me to claim your prize.

Hidden within the code's embrace,
A flag to find in this riddle's space.
Look for clues, read between the lines,
The solution awaits, the treasure shines.

In letters and numbers, a pattern to see,
Unlock the mystery, set it free.
I have 91 p1 bugs at T1.
I have Benzene(CH).
Crack the code, reveal the key,
And i also have code to my vault name "34T".
And the secret, yours it will be if you combined what i have.

But my darling was not able to do so.
All she must do is to read and figure out.
Now i ask you this, am i complicated?
Or she's just loss the mind of my riddle?
